to run lpair:

sometimes a card with a filename other than "lpair.card" will not be recognized by the program.

rename your card to follow "lpair.card" and simply run "./lpair" since the program uses the default card "lpair.card" as input.

the output will be "events.root"

run "root -q -b ConvertLPairToLHE.C" to convert "events.root" to "events.lhe".

c'est tout.
