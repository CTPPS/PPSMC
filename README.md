# CTPPSMC
Repository of the Monte Carlo working group of CT-PPS

The shell scripts are intended to document and to organized the steps needed to setup and run the FPMC event generator and CT-PPS simulation at LXPLUS machines.

One can simply run all steps from a given directory by choosing the necessary parameters for a particular case, e.g., CMSSW release, entries in the fpmc input card and the cmsDriver input parameters.
